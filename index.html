                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Vane Stojanov and I live at small municipality called Rosoman. Currently I'm student at FCSE(Faculty of computer science and engineering) and I'm studying SEIS(Software engineering and information systems). I almost finished my first year at the faculty and I reccomend it to everyone who wants to learn more about computers and programming. I have basic to intermediate knowledge at C/C++ and basic knowledge for HTML/CSS.</p>

                    <h2>Things I like</h2>
                    <p>
                        Well, now when I have to write about this, I can't remember a lot of things I like suddenly.. So, let's see, I guess this paragraph will be the short one.
 I like sport, football mostly and basketball after that. My favorite football club is Real Madrid, you can read more about it in the paragraph
 <a href="#club" style="color: black;">below</a>, I also support few local clubs like FK Tikves from Kavadarci and FK Rosoman 83 from my own hometown.
 I like playing video games, mostly ones that include some type of RolePlay, also, I prefer team games like
Counter Strike Global Offensive and I enjoy playing Total War and other strategy games. I have big interest in politics, because as the saying goes, "If you do not bother with politics,
 it bothers you and you let the fools rule over you". So, overall, that's it with this paragraph.

                        <h2>Favorite football club</h2>
                        <p>
                            My favorite football club is Real Madrid, I don't know how I started liking it, maybe because my father was praising Iker Casillas as the best goalkeeper in the world and maybe the best
goalkeeper of all time, or maybe because most of my friends were supporting Barcelona and it's golder generation of Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets, Messi, Puyol, etc, and it was boring for everyone
to support the same club. This year, Real Madrid are again the winners of the Champions League, it's their 14-th Champions League title, and Real Madrid are the kings of Europe for a reason :D.
You can read more about the club <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF" style="color: black; target="_blank"">here</a>.

                        <h2>My country</h2>
                        <p>And now, probably my favorite part, my country MACEDONIA. I have mixed feelings when writing for this part, because it can be my favorite and my least favorite part to write about
at the same time. I live in Macedonia, in small place called Rosoman. Our country gained it's freedom in 1991 through voting, unlike the other countries from former Yugoslavia which
had to go through war to gain their independence. I'm nationalist and not patriot, because a lot of people don't know the difference between patriot and nationalist, I'll try to explain
the difference. Patriot is someone who loves the country, the culture maybe, nationalist is someone who loves the nation, the Macedonian culture, the Macedonian people, language, so, for
me as a nationalist, Macedonia will exist as long as there's at least one Macedonian alive. My country has been robbed and betrayed by the politicians many times, corruption is high to the
sky, but I still have faith that one day, we, the true Macedonians will raise this country from the ashes like the beautiful bird, the Fenix.</p>
